# Data2Music
Code to support a brute force passwd algorithm to music
The "gist" of this idea allows arrays of alpha numeric characters to be relatively be mapped to a given musical scale
the end result, a generated midi file of the new "score". Future versions will allow for a progression of scales to make a 
more "variable" score.


The above was the original idea, however as one might guess, this whole idea is expanded so that the input "data" that drives the music creation in this code is, the words from an Epub. The program will identify "Interesting" Proper nous, etc that will be ideally Major Characters and locations from the EPub. Once run, the program will generate a list of these that are numerically identified each of these potentential sources for Musical themes, sequences etc. to allow the user to specify which story elements they wish to generate.
